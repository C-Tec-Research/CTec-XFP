		  "• Devices page:",
		  "  o IO config settings were not downloading/uploading correctly.",
		  "• Zones page:",
		  "  o Now handles null day/night values properly when selecting a panel item.",
		  "• Groups page:",
		  "  o Corrected the default values for first 5 columns of zones and panels to be Evac, not Alert.",
		  "• Sets page:",
		  "  o Corrected the default values for first 2 columns of zones and columns to be Continuous.",
		  "  o Corrected the default Silenceable settings so that panel relay set 1 is silenceable.",
		  "  o Fixed an error where the panel values were overwriting the first 8 zones on screen.  This made it appear that the zones were wrong, although the data behind was correct.",
		  "  o A typo has been corrected which was parsing panel relay triggers incorrectly.",
		  "• Causes and Effects page:",
		  "  o The default trigger and reset conditions are now implicitly True and False respectively, rather than null.  This prevents annoying error boxes being shown when new triggers are added.",
